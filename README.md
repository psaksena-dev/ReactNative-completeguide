# React Native - A Complete Guide

## What is React Native?

- A colleciton of "special" react components
- Components compiled to Native (iOS / Andriod) widgets
- Native Platform APIs exposed to Javascript
- Connects Javascript and Native Platform Code

ReactJS + React Native = Real Native Mobile Apps (iOS / Android)

For UI, React Native provides components which are compiled to native views. For other logic, it is written in JavaScript. It is not compiled. Javascript runs on a special thread hosted by React Native App.
